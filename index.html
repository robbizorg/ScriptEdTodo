<!-- TODO App Project
	 * Build an App that allows users to make a simple TODO List
	 * Seems easy, but it will require all your skills that you've used up to this point!
	 * Refer to the Example in the DSD if you need
	 * Minimum:
	 	* Use jQuery/JavaScript to allow users to make a list
	 	* Create a button that cleans the todo list
	 * Challenge:
	 	* Use jQuery/JavaScript to allow users to edit/delete individual posts
	 * Hints:
	 	* You're going to have to use JavaScript Variables and Arrays to do this project (well)
	 	* Look up JavaScript functions to keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
	 		* If you find yourself writing the same code twice, make it a function!
